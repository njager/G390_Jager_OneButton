# G390_Jager_OneButton
About
    For this prototype I wanted to focus on just having a fun core mechanic that fit the one button theme. My last game was more about a narrative experience, so this game I switched gears and did no story, no art, just gameplay. 
    The theme inspired this game because the player needed to make progress with a single button, so forcing the player to move in one direction while giving the player the ability to use a variable jump felt like it made the most sense.
    The game begins easy then switches to harder platforms. There are 12 different varieties of platforms. The game is endless once you reach the hard platforms, with the engine randomly choosing from a list.
Controls
    Spacebar to jump.
    Hold to jump higher
Assets
    All assets are primitives made in Unity.
    The music is an EDM loop I made for Game Art and Sound.
